## Context
The current time management system is a single-page application built with vanilla JavaScript. It serves as a comprehensive time tracking tool with sleep monitoring, activity logging, and statistics analysis. The application currently uses local storage for data persistence, which limits multi-device access and data backup capabilities.

## Goals / Non-Goals
- **Goals**:
  - Modernize the tech stack while preserving all existing functionality
  - Enable cloud synchronization and multi-user support
  - Improve development experience with TypeScript and modern tooling
  - Enhance UI/UX with modern design system (shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS)
  - Add proper testing and deployment pipelines
  - Improve performance and maintainability

- **Non-Goals**:
  - Add new features beyond existing capabilities during refactoring
  - Change the core user workflow or feature set
  - Implement complex analytics or AI features

## Decisions

### Frontend Framework: Next.js + React + TypeScript
- **Decision**: Use Next.js with React and TypeScript for the frontend
- **Rationale**:
  - Next.js provides SSR, API routes, and excellent development experience
  - React provides component-based architecture with large ecosystem
  - TypeScript adds type safety and better developer experience
  - Vite integration provides fast development builds

### Database & Backend: Supabase
- **Decision**: Use Supabase as the backend-as-a-service provider
- **Rationale**:
  - Provides PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities
  - Built-in authentication with social providers
  - Auto-generated API and SDK
  - Easy migration from local storage to cloud storage
  - Good free tier for personal projects

### UI Framework: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **Decision**: Use shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Rationale**:
  - shadcn/ui provides modern, accessible components built on Radix UI
  - Tailwind CSS offers utility-first styling approach
  - Both integrate seamlessly with React/Next.js
  - Consistent design system with dark mode support

### Development Tooling
- **Decision**: Use Vite for development and build tooling
- **Rationale**:
  - Fast hot module replacement during development
  - Optimized production builds
  - Excellent TypeScript support
  - Large plugin ecosystem

## Risks / Trade-offs
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn new tech stack (Next.js, Supabase, TypeScript)
- **Initial Complexity**: More complex setup compared to vanilla JavaScript
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Dependence on Supabase services
- **Migration Risk**: Potential data loss during local storage to Supabase migration
- **Performance**: Initial load time may increase due to framework overhead

## Migration Plan
1. **Setup Phase**: Initialize Next.js project with required dependencies
2. **Database Schema**: Design Supabase schema matching current data structure
3. **Authentication**: Implement user authentication system
4. **Component Migration**: Recreate UI components using React/shadcn/ui
5. **Data Layer**: Implement data access layer with Supabase client
6. **Feature Implementation**: Reimplement features one by one (sleep tracking, activities, statistics)
7. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
8. **Migration Tool**: Create data migration tool from local storage to Supabase
9. **Deployment**: Deploy to production platform

## Open Questions
- Should we implement data export/import functionality for backup?
- How to handle offline mode when Supabase is unavailable?
- What's the preferred hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)?
- Should we implement data visualization library migration (Chart.js to something modern)?
