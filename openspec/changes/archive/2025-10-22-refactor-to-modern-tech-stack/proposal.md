## Why
The current time management system is built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript and uses local storage for data persistence. This limits scalability, maintainability, and user experience. A modern tech stack will provide better development experience, improved performance, and enhanced capabilities.

## What Changes
- **Technology Stack Migration**: Migrate from vanilla JavaScript to React + TypeScript + Vite + Next.js + Supabase + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **Data Persistence**: Replace local storage with Supabase database for cloud storage and synchronization
- **UI Framework**: Implement modern, responsive UI using shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS
- **Development Tooling**: Add TypeScript for type safety, Vite for fast development, and Next.js for full-stack capabilities
- **State Management**: Implement proper state management patterns with React hooks and context
- **Authentication**: Add user authentication and multi-user support via Supabase Auth
- **API Integration**: Create proper API layer for data operations
- **Testing**: Add comprehensive testing setup with modern testing frameworks
- **Deployment**: Modernize deployment configuration for cloud platforms

## Impact
- **Affected specs**: time-tracking, daily-planning, statistics-overview (all existing capabilities will be preserved)
- **Affected code**: Complete rewrite of frontend codebase (index.html, src/js/*, src/css/*)
- **Data migration**: Need to migrate existing local storage data to Supabase
- **Breaking changes**: This is a complete rewrite - all existing functionality will be re-implemented with the same user-facing features
