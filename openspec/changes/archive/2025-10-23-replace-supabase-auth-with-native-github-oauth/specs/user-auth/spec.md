## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Native GitHub OAuth Authentication
The system SHALL implement direct GitHub OAuth2 authentication without third-party auth services.

#### Scenario: User initiates GitHub login
- **WHEN** user clicks "Login with GitHub" button
- **THEN** application initiates GitHub OAuth2 Authorization Code flow
- **AND** user is redirected to GitHub OAuth consent screen
- **AND** system generates and stores PKCE verifier for security

#### Scenario: GitHub OAuth callback handling
- **WHEN** user is redirected back from GitHub with authorization code
- **THEN** application exchanges code for access token using PKCE verifier
- **AND** retrieves GitHub user profile information
- **AND** creates or updates user record in database
- **AND** establishes JWT session for user

#### Scenario: First-time GitHub user authentication
- **WHEN** a GitHub user authenticates for the first time
- **THEN** new user account is created using GitHub profile data
- **AND** user is assigned default preferences and settings
- **AND** JWT session is established and user is redirected to dashboard

#### Scenario: Existing GitHub user authentication
- **WHEN** an existing GitHub user authenticates
- **THEN** user profile is synchronized with latest GitHub information
- **AND** existing user data and preferences are preserved
- **AND** JWT session is established and user is redirected to dashboard

#### Scenario: Session validation and refresh
- **WHEN** user accesses protected routes
- **THEN** JWT session is validated on server side
- **AND** if token is expired, system attempts refresh using refresh token
- **AND** user is maintained logged in if refresh succeeds

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Supabase Authentication Integration
**Reason**: Removing dependency on Supabase Auth to simplify authentication stack
**Migration**: Transition to native JWT-based session management

#### Scenario: Supabase session management
- **WHEN** application checks authentication state
- **THEN** Supabase auth session validation is no longer used
- **AND** JWT token validation replaces Supabase session checks

### Requirement: Supabase Auth Helper Integration
**Reason**: Eliminating Supabase auth helpers and middleware
**Migration**: Replace with native Next.js authentication patterns

#### Scenario: Authentication context initialization
- **WHEN** AuthProvider component initializes
- **THEN** Supabase auth listeners are removed
- **AND** JWT session validation is implemented instead

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: JWT Session Management
The system SHALL implement secure JWT-based session management for authenticated users.

#### Scenario: Session creation
- **WHEN** user successfully authenticates via GitHub OAuth
- **THEN** system generates JWT containing user ID and GitHub information
- **AND** JWT is stored in httpOnly, secure cookie
- **AND** refresh token is stored for future session renewal

#### Scenario: Session validation
- **WHEN** protected route is accessed
- **THEN** middleware validates JWT from cookie
- **AND** user context is populated with validated user data
- **AND** access is granted if JWT is valid and not expired

#### Scenario: Session refresh
- **WHEN** JWT is approaching expiration
- **THEN** system automatically refreshes session using refresh token
- **AND** new JWT is issued and stored in cookie
- **AND** user session continues without interruption

#### Scenario: Session termination
- **WHEN** user clicks logout
- **THEN** JWT and refresh token cookies are cleared
- **AND** user is redirected to login page
- **AND** authentication state is reset

### Requirement: GitHub OAuth Configuration
The system SHALL support configurable GitHub OAuth2 application settings.

#### Scenario: OAuth initialization
- **WHEN** application starts
- **THEN** GitHub OAuth client ID and secret are loaded from environment
- **AND** callback URL is configured for OAuth redirect
- **AND** proper scopes are requested for user profile access

#### Scenario: Error handling
- **WHEN** GitHub OAuth flow encounters errors
- **THEN** descriptive error messages are shown to user
- **AND** error details are logged for debugging
- **AND** user can retry authentication process

### Requirement: User Data Migration
The system SHALL preserve existing user data during authentication system transition.

#### Scenario: Existing user data preservation
- **WHEN** authentication system is migrated
- **THEN** all existing user activities and preferences are preserved
- **AND** data is linked to GitHub user ID for continuity
- **AND** no user-generated content is lost during transition
