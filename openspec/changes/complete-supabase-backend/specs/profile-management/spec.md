# Profile Management Specification

## Purpose
Enable comprehensive user profile management with GitHub OAuth integration and persistent user data storage.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: GitHub OAuth Profile Integration
The system SHALL create and manage user profiles using GitHub OAuth authentication data.

#### Scenario: Automatic profile creation on first login
- **WHEN** a user authenticates via GitHub OAuth for the first time
- **THEN** the system SHALL automatically create a profile record with GitHub user data
- **AND** the system SHALL store GitHub username, user ID, and avatar URL
- **AND** the system SHALL set the auth_provider field to 'github'
- **AND** the system SHALL use the GitHub user ID as the profile identifier

#### Scenario: Profile data synchronization

- **THEN** the system SHALL display editable fields for timezone and preferences
- **AND** the system SHALL prevent editing of GitHub-synchronized fields (username, avatar)
- **AND** the system SHALL save profile changes to Supabase with proper validation

### Requirement: Profile Data Persistence
The system SHALL ensure all user profile data is properly persisted and retrievable across sessions.

#### Scenario: Profile retrieval on app load
- **WHEN** the application loads with an authenticated user
- **THEN** the system SHALL fetch the user's profile from Supabase
- **AND** the system SHALL cache the profile data for efficient access
- **AND** the system SHALL handle missing profiles by creating default ones

#### Scenario: Profile update handling

- **THEN** the system SHALL validate the input data
- **AND** the system SHALL update the profile in Supabase
- **AND** the system SHALL refresh the cached profile data
- **AND** the system SHALL trigger real-time updates to other connected devices

### Requirement: Profile Security and Privacy
The system SHALL ensure profile data is secure and only accessible by the owning user.

#### Scenario: Profile access control
- **WHEN** any database operation is performed on profile data
- **THEN** the system SHALL enforce Row Level Security policies
- **AND** the system SHALL ensure users can only access their own profile data
- **AND** the system SHALL validate JWT tokens before allowing profile operations

#### Scenario: Profile data sanitization
- **WHEN** profile data is returned to the client
- **THEN** the system SHALL sanitize sensitive information
- **AND** the system SHALL only include fields necessary for the UI
- **AND** the system SHALL exclude internal database fields
