# Real-time Synchronization Specification

## Purpose
Enable real-time data synchronization across all user devices with automatic conflict resolution and offline support.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Real-time Data Subscriptions
The system SHALL establish real-time subscriptions for all user data to enable live synchronization.

#### Scenario: Activity synchronization
- **WHEN** a user creates, updates, or deletes an activity
- **THEN** the system SHALL immediately broadcast the change to all connected devices
- **AND** the system SHALL update the UI on all devices without manual refresh
- **AND** the system SHALL maintain consistent activity order and state across devices

#### Scenario: Sleep record synchronization
- **WHEN** sleep data is added or modified on any device
- **THEN** the system SHALL sync the changes to all user devices in real-time
- **AND** the system SHALL update sleep statistics and charts automatically
- **AND** the system SHALL prevent duplicate entries for the same date

#### Scenario: Goal progress synchronization
- **WHEN** goal progress is updated through any activity
- **THEN** the system SHALL recalculate and sync goal progress to all devices
- **AND** the system SHALL update goal completion status and notifications
- **AND** the system SHALL maintain consistent goal state across all clients

### Requirement: Real-time Authentication State
The system SHALL synchronize authentication state and profile changes across devices.

#### Scenario: Profile updates synchronization
- **WHEN** a user updates their profile information
- **THEN** the system SHALL broadcast profile changes to all active sessions
- **AND** the system SHALL update profile displays in real-time
- **AND** the system SHALL handle GitHub OAuth data changes appropriately

#### Scenario: Multi-session management
- **WHEN** a user logs in on multiple devices
- **THEN** the system SHALL maintain separate authentication tokens for each device
- **AND** the system SHALL allow simultaneous access from multiple devices
- **AND** the system SHALL handle logout on one device without affecting others

### Requirement: Conflict Resolution
The system SHALL provide automatic conflict resolution for concurrent data modifications.

#### Scenario: Concurrent activity editing
- **WHEN** the same activity is edited simultaneously on multiple devices
- **THEN** the system SHALL use last-write-wins strategy with timestamp comparison
- **AND** the system SHALL preserve all non-conflicting field changes
- **AND** the system SHALL notify user of automatic conflict resolution

#### Scenario: Data integrity validation
- **WHEN** synchronized data is received from another device
- **THEN** the system SHALL validate data integrity and schema compliance
- **AND** the system SHALL reject or repair invalid data automatically
- **AND** the system SHALL log validation failures for debugging

### Requirement: Offline Support and Sync Queue
The system SHALL provide offline functionality with automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored.

#### Scenario: Offline data creation
- **WHEN** user creates data while offline
- **THEN** the system SHALL store data locally with queued synchronization
- **AND** the system SHALL indicate offline status to the user
- **AND** the system SHALL allow full application functionality while offline

#### Scenario: Automatic sync restoration
- **WHEN** network connectivity is restored
- **THEN** the system SHALL automatically process the synchronization queue
- **AND** the system SHALL resolve any conflicts that occurred during offline period
- **AND** the system SHALL notify user of successful synchronization

#### Scenario: Sync queue management
- **WHEN** multiple changes are queued during offline period
- **THEN** the system SHALL process changes in chronological order
- **AND** the system SHALL batch related operations for efficiency
- **AND** the system SHALL handle large sync queues without blocking the UI

### Requirement: Real-time Performance Optimization
The system SHALL optimize real-time synchronization for performance and bandwidth efficiency.

#### Scenario: Subscription filtering
- **WHEN** establishing real-time subscriptions
- **THEN** the system SHALL filter data to only include user's own data
- **AND** the system SHALL minimize unnecessary data transfers
- **AND** the system SHALL use efficient query patterns for subscription filters

#### Scenario: Debounced updates
- **WHEN** rapid successive changes occur to the same data
- **THEN** the system SHALL debounce updates to reduce network traffic
- **AND** the system SHALL maintain responsiveness while reducing sync operations
- **AND** the system SHALL ensure final state is correctly synchronized

#### Scenario: Connection health monitoring
- **WHEN** real-time connection is established
- **THEN** the system SHALL monitor connection health and latency
- **AND** the system SHALL automatically reconnect on connection failures
- **AND** the system SHALL provide user feedback for connection issues
